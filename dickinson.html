        <strong>My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun</strong>
        BY EMILY DICKINSON
        <br /><br />My Life had stood - a Loaded Gun -
        In Corners - till a Day
        The Owner passed - identified -
        And carried Me away -
        <br /><br />
        And now We roam in Sovreign Woods -
        And now We hunt the Doe -
        And every time I speak for Him
        The Mountains straight reply -
        <br /><br />
        And do I smile, such cordial light
        Opon the Valley glow -
        It is as a Vesuvian face
        Had let it’s pleasure through -
        <br /><br />
        And when at Night - Our good Day done -
        I guard My Master’s Head -
        ’Tis better than the Eider Duck’s
        Deep Pillow - to have shared -
        <br /><br />
        To foe of His - I’m deadly foe -
        None stir the second time -
        On whom I lay a Yellow Eye -
        Or an emphatic Thumb -
        <br /><br />
        Though I than He - may longer live
        He longer must - than I -
        For I have but the power to kill,
        Without - the power to die -</p>
